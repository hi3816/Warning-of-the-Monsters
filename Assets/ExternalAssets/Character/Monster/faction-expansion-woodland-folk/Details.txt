FANTASY RPG Faction Expansion - Woodland Folk  (by Franuka) v1.0
-------------------------
Thank you for getting this asset pack!
Included are the files for each asset in three sizes (100%, 200% and 300%), .png format, transparent background.

Frame size depends on the file, but they all fit a 16x16 grid. To know the exact frame size of a character, you need to divide file size by the number of columns (for width) or rows (for height). For example, Deer01_idle.png's file size is 64x128px (1x version), and it has 4 columns and 4 rows. 64/4 = 16 , and 128/4 = 32. Thus, frame size is 16x32px.
